# Set up and Take Down Instructions

##  Emergency Take Down

If for any reason you need to evacuate people from the dome:

* Tell everyone to move away from the rim
* Stand up and turn toward the wall on the air vent side
* Reach high and pull the wall down hard (grab what you can, and go from tip toes to a squatting position.)
* The dome will cascade down in front of you, you may need to keep pulling the wall down to ensure the cascade.

## Materials
1. Dome
1. Mirror
1. Projector
1. Fan
1. Laptop
1. Extension cord, power strip
1. HDMI cable
1. Computer and projector power cords
1. Flashlight

Optional but useful:
1. Mouse (and xbox controller if you want)
1. Rope lights (or Christmas lights for "house lights")
1. Microphone system

## Dome Setup

1. Unpack and unroll dome keeping track of dome "hose".
1. Plug in fan and attach fan hose.
1. Begin inflating fan on speed "3". Help dome inflate if itâ€™s tangled or struggling.
1. Once dome is fully inflated, slide all necessary equipment under dome. (hang onto the flashlight!)
1. Plug in Christmas lights and wind around the perimeter of the dome.

## Optical Setup

1. Position your chair, the mirror, and the projector just to the left of the main air vent.
1. Put the mirror on the music stand with the widest opening to the top
1. Plug in projector, aim projector beam directly at the bottom center of the mirror.


## Computer Setup

1. Plug in and turn on laptop.
1. Attach mouse/xbox controller if desired.
1. Using the hdmi cable, connect the computer to the projector.
1. Turn on projector.
1. "Extend" the projector. The projector may already be set up like this. If it is, the projector should just be projecting the desktop image and not mirroring the movements of the mouse on the laptop screen. If it is not already set this way, press function+F8 (or function + the image of two screens on the function bar), and select "extend".
1. Run WWT, hit the pull down view tab, go to full dome, and click "detach main view to second monitor".
1. Return to full dome in the view tab and select "full dome"
1. Return to view tab and select "dome setup," be sure "Mirror dome 16:9" is selected and no boxes are checked.
1. You should be ready to go!

## Maintaining the dome.

* The fan should be on 3 when inflating and when people enter and exit.
* The fan can run on speed 2 or 1 during a show. If the bottom rim of the dome is flapping, it means the fan speed is too high.


## Before People Enter

* Explain it is like a bouncy castle with no bottom, so the floor is this floor. If there are chairs/benches let them know how many and if they are reserved for adults, etc.
* Explain that there is precision equipment next to the presenter, and everyone should be very careful not to touch or bump into it.
* Tell everyone to sit in the same direction as the presenter (can also happen in the dome)

## Before Starting a Show

* Tell everyone to sit in the same direction as the presenter
* If anyone feels sea sick, look down, or close their eyes.
* If anyone wishes to leave at any time, they may, simply let the presenter know so the assistant can help them out.
* Keep side-conversations to a minimum, even a whisper can be heard on the other side of the dome.

## Take Down Instructions

1. Push all equipment to the center of the dome
1. Leave the dome and make sure area around the dome is empty (especially of children)
1. Lift and throw the dome from the bottom rim opposite the air vent.
1. Turn the fan off
1. Pack up equipment
1. Roll up the dome:
  * pull the dome as long as it can go, as if it were becoming a rectangle
  * tuck in rim to the floor and push into the center, making the rectangle shape smaller
  * from one side of the rectangle, roll the dome, using you knees to push out excess air
  * drop the open bag on top of the rolled dome and flip the entire dome over
  * zip up the bag
  * (I like to try and keep the "hose" easy to find for the next user)
